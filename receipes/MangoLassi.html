    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mango Lassi is a traditional Indian drink made with ripe mangoes, yogurt, sugar, and a touch of cardamom.

    <p>
        It is a refreshing, creamy beverage that combines the sweetness of mangoes with the tanginess of yogurt. Often served chilled, it is popular during hot weather or as a complement to spicy meals.
